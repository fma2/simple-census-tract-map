# simple-census-tract-map

Made using Ruby, Sinatra, and Mapbox, this is a simple app that takes tab-delimited data on U.S. Census tracts around Oakland, CA, calculates population and housing densities for each place, and displays them on a map, also highlighting the densest and sparsest places.  

Map is deployed to Heroku: https://simple-census-tract-map.herokuapp.com/.
